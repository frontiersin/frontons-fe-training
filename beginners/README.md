## Submissions
The assignment should be submitted in the form of a GitHub repo. The repo should have proper `README` documentaion in place, so that the solution be verified easily. Also, ensure proper branching strategy is in place for your own repo, for example, __do not push everything in progress to the `main`branch__. The recommended way is to raise Pull requests with every small feature and changes to the `development` branch and once the solution is concrete and stable, get it merged to the main.
